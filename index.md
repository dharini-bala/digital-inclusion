# Digital Inclusion in Later Life
## Overview
The growing digitalisation of essential and optional services increasingly necessitates the use of digital resources. Routine tasks in everyday life now typically require the ability to use systems aimed at a digitally literate population.
 
Digital exclusion is linked not only to the lack of access to digital devices and the Internet, but also to the lack of digital literacy and motivation. Literature suggests that digital literacy is inversely related to age. While older adults are not homogeneous in their abilities and attitudes, the consequences of ageing can affect the ability of this group to adopt diverse and fast evolving digital technologies. Yet, these technologies are increasingly needed to improve the quality of life and preserve the independence of older adults. Thus, digital exclusion may have a particularly significant effect on the older population. The knock on effect of the problem can also affect family, friends and service providers supporting older adults. The rapidly changing digital landscape, failure by software professionals to consider accessibility of digital solutions to older adults, and the rise in population ageing exacerbate this challenge.

This project aims to improve the digital inclusion of adults in later life through 3 approaches:
- Creating resources to improve the digital literacy of older adults in our communities,
- Producing guidance for software and interaction designers in developing digital services that are more accessible to older adults, and
- Providing support for those who support older adults with digital access.
 
We will work in collaboration with local organisations and using iterative co-design processes to address this challenge.
